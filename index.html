    here will be a site
    
    what is this for:
    - transfer data between elements that are tied together.
    for example: IoT, robots, smart Home appliances.
    
    video of running the samples
    
    
    audience:
    - programmers of all types and languages.
    but you must be capable in at least one language: C#, C++, C, Javascript.
    - makers: if you build robots, toys, mechanical stuff.
    this server can also be of great use especially for you.
    
    
    
    first time install (a one time process to make your PC capable of running the server)
    - install nodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
    for standard installations, just pick the Windows installer for 64-bit
    
    - go to the directory of the future server (preferably a different directory then the rest of the app)
    and run CMD from there. 
    type: npm install
    
    after that your folder should be filled with our libs and a file called server.js
    
    (add a picture of the right folder content)
