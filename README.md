this server can also be of great use especially for you.



# first time install (a one time process to make your PC capable of running the server)
- install nodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
for standard installations, just pick the Windows installer for 64-bit

- go to the directory of the future server (preferably a different directory then the rest of the app)
and run CMD from there. 
type: npm install

after that your folder should be filled with our libs and a file called server.js
