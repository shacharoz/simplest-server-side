# first time install (a one time process to make your PC capable of running the server)
- install nodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
for standard installations, just pick the Windows installer for 64-bit

- create a new directory for the server files

- copy the initial install files into the server folder
take these files from the "first-install" directory
you should have: server.js , routes.js , package.json

- install the server by typing "npm install" from the CMD of the server folder 
after that your folder should have another folder called "node_modules" with lots of sub-folders and files

(add a picture of the right folder content)
